# VibeCAD

VibeCAD is an AI-native parametric CAD platform for designing real 3D parts through conversation, focused modeling tools, and editable geometry history.

## Before You Start

You need either a **ChatGPT subscription** or an **API key** for the provider you select. VibeCAD supports ChatGPT subscription sign-in through its bundled Codex runtime, connects directly to OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, and can use OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as xAI, Ollama, and other local model servers.

Store the key in one of these places:

- **OS keyring (recommended):** paste the key in VibeCAD Preferences, click **Save Key**, and then click **Validate**.
- **A selected `.env` file:** create the file yourself, select it in VibeCAD Preferences, and click **Validate**. VibeCAD does not search for `.env` files automatically.

API keys are not stored in ordinary application preferences. ChatGPT OAuth credentials are owned and refreshed by the bundled Codex app-server; VibeCAD does not read or copy those tokens.

## Install

Download the latest build from [VibeCAD Releases](https://github.com/10-X-eng/vibecad/releases/latest).

### Linux AppImage

```bash
chmod +x VibeCAD*.AppImage
./VibeCAD*.AppImage
```

### Debian Package

Run this command from the directory containing the downloaded package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./vibecad_*_amd64.deb
```

The leading `./` is required when installing a local package with `apt`.

### Windows

Download the Windows installer, run it, and launch VibeCAD from the Start menu. A portable archive is also available for installations that should not modify the system.

SHA256 files are published beside release artifacts so downloads can be verified before installation.

## Configure an AI Provider

Open **Preferences**, then select **VibeCAD > VibeCAD**.

1. Enable **Use online provider**.
2. Select **ChatGPT subscription**, **OpenAI**, or **Anthropic** under **Provider**.
3. For ChatGPT, use the account sign-in controls described below. For an API provider, configure its key and leave the base URL blank unless you use a compatible or local endpoint.
4. Configure the selected provider's authentication.
5. Click **Fetch models**, then select a returned model.
6. Choose a supported **Reasoning effort**. Use `none` when a model does not support thinking or reasoning parameters.
7. Click **Apply** or **OK** to save the provider, model, endpoint, and `.env` path settings.

### Sign In With a ChatGPT Subscription

1. Select **ChatGPT subscription** as the provider.
2. Click **Sign in with ChatGPT** and complete the browser flow. Use **Use device code** when the browser callback cannot reach VibeCAD.
3. Click **Fetch models** and select a subscription model, or leave **Use account default** selected.
4. Choose a reasoning effort offered by that model, then click **Apply** or **OK**.

ChatGPT credentials are stored in a private VibeCAD Codex credential directory and refreshed by the bundled, version-pinned app-server. **Logout** asks that runtime to remove the account. VibeCAD never imports credentials from another Codex installation and never falls back to an ambient API key.

ChatGPT subscription, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and offline/debug turns all
use the same global modeling-engine and active-workbench resolver. Select
**Native** or **VibeScript** in any supported modeling workbench before sending
a request. Part Design additionally offers **build123d** and **OpenSCAD** when
those engines are enabled. A turn receives only the selected engine's exact
active-workbench surface; VibeScript and native CAD tools are never combined.

### Save a Key in the OS Keyring

1. Select the provider first. Keys are stored separately for OpenAI and Anthropic.
2. Paste the provider key into **API key**.
3. Click **Save Key**. The field clears after VibeCAD hands the key to the operating system's credential store.
4. Click **Validate**. A successful check reports `verified` in **Auth status**.
5. Click **Fetch models** and choose the model to use.

**Logout** removes only the selected provider's keyring entry. It does not remove a process environment variable or edit a selected `.env` file.

### Use a `.env` File

Create a text file containing the variable for the selected provider:

```dotenv
# OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible providers, including xAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

In VibeCAD Preferences:

1. Click **Browse** beside **.env path** and select that exact file.
2. Leave the **API key** field empty; **Save Key** is only for the OS keyring.
3. Click **Validate**, then **Fetch models**.
4. Click **Apply** or **OK** so the selected path is used by future sessions.

Do not commit a `.env` file containing a real key to source control.

### Credential Precedence

VibeCAD resolves a key in this order:

1. The provider's process environment variable.
2. The `.env` file explicitly selected in Preferences.
3. The OS keyring.

This order matters when a valid key appears to be ignored. For example, an old `OPENAI_API_KEY` exported by the shell overrides both the selected `.env` file and a newer key saved in the keyring.

## Configure Grok Through xAI

xAI exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so Grok uses VibeCAD's OpenAI provider adapter:

1. Obtain an API key from xAI.
2. Select **OpenAI** as the provider.
3. Set **OpenAI base URL** to `https://api.x.ai/v1`.
4. Paste the xAI key, click **Save Key**, and then click **Validate**.
5. Click **Fetch models** and select the Grok model returned by xAI.
6. Choose a reasoning effort supported by that model, then click **Apply** or **OK**.

When using a `.env` file for xAI, use `OPENAI_API_KEY` because the OpenAI-compatible provider adapter is selected.

## Start a CAD Conversation

1. Create or open a CAD document and **save it**. VibeCAD keeps the assistant disabled for unsaved documents so the conversation, design record, references, and generated source have a durable project location.
2. Select the workbench that matches the work you are doing. VibeCAD exposes the focused tool surface for the active workbench.
3. Open **View > Panels > VibeCAD Assistant** if the assistant is not visible.
4. Describe the intended result, including the dimensions, interfaces, material, manufacturing process, and constraints that matter.
5. Use **Attach Image** for a reference design, or paste an image into the message box with `Ctrl+V`. Use **Attach View** to include the current viewport in the next model request only; it is consumed after that delivery.
6. Click **Send**. While work is running, the same input becomes **Steer**, so corrections stay in the same conversation. **Stop** ends the run after the current provider or CAD step returns.
7. Save the CAD document normally. Reopening it restores the associated VibeCAD conversations and project records.

Be explicit about functional intent, not only appearance. For an existing model, identify what should be preserved and what should change. For a new part, provide mating geometry and critical dimensions whenever they are known.

## Conversations

The conversation selector at the top of the assistant opens prior conversations for the current CAD document. The new-conversation button starts a clean thread without deleting earlier work. This makes it possible to separate a redesign, manufacturing discussion, or analysis task while retaining the project's history.

Saved conversations remain available to the human in this selector, but VibeCAD does not replay the project transcript or persisted tool traces into a model request. The model receives the current message exactly once. **Intent Memory** remains available as an explicit human project record, but it is not compiled after every turn or injected automatically.

Turn-start CAD context is deliberately small: active workbench/engine/domain, document identity and object count, edit object, and the exact explicit selection. Object inventories, properties, programs, domain APIs, geometry, solver state, and old images are read only when the model calls the bounded `core.inspect` tool. Newly attached reference images and **Attach View** are delivered once. Exact active tool declarations have a hard wire-size limit, as do inspection pages and individual tool results.

## Global Modeling Engine

The modeling-engine selector appears in the VibeCAD panel in every supported user workbench. The human controls this global selection for each saved CAD document; AI tools cannot change it.

- **Native:** only the active workbench's native CAD tools.
- **VibeScript:** only the active workbench's dedicated source-backed interface; selected by default.
- **build123d:** optional Part Design-only Python modeling.
- **OpenSCAD:** optional Part Design-only OpenSCAD modeling.

Native and VibeScript authoring tools are never combined, and tools from different workbenches are never combined. Leaving Part Design while build123d or OpenSCAD is selected visibly changes and persists the global engine as VibeScript. Returning to Part Design does not restore the previous engine.

Scripted engines keep source, inputs, diagnostics, revisions, and accepted outputs with the project. VibeScript runs in an isolated windowless worker and publishes only validated results. The **Model Code Editor** lists programs for the active workbench domain and opens with no program selected.

All 18 supported user-workbench VibeScript interfaces are production-ready:
Part Design, Sketcher, Part, Draft, Surface, Assembly, Spreadsheet, Material,
BIM, Mesh, MeshPart, Points, Reverse Engineering, Inspection, Robot, FEM, CAM,
and TechDraw. Every domain, including Part Design, exposes the same five
provider-facing mutation tools plus the shared `core.inspect` read interface.
API inspection and program source contain only that workbench's canonical
runtime operations and typed outputs.

Geometry, solver, mesh, reconstruction, projection, and toolpath work runs in
the isolated worker. The live document receives only independently validated,
precomputed native state under stable program/output identities. This includes
native sketches and Draft/BIM proxies, Assembly links and joints, sheets and
material assignments, meshes and point clouds, reconstruction and inspection
records, Robot trajectories, FEM analyses/results, Path jobs/toolpaths, and
TechDraw pages/views/dimensions. Failed candidates remain inspectable without
replacing the accepted revision, and publication/deletion paths explicitly
restore accepted state when FreeCAD transaction rollback is incomplete.

Part, MeshPart, Points, CAM, and TechDraw deliberately collapse equivalent
variants behind selectors or one ordered pipeline instead of advertising
redundant operations. There are no forwarding wrappers for removed Part
operations; `core.inspect` presents the only canonical runtime methods. Startup,
test, unknown, or future unimplemented workbenches resolve to an exact core-only
unavailable surface; VibeCAD never substitutes another workbench's tools.

## Local Models

For Ollama or another local OpenAI-compatible server, select the OpenAI provider and configure its endpoint. A common Ollama setup is:

```text
OpenAI base URL: http://localhost:11434/v1
Model: select a model returned by Fetch models
API key: any non-empty value accepted by the local server
Reasoning effort: none
```

The local server must already be running and expose an OpenAI-compatible API. Some local models reject reasoning parameters even when the server supports the endpoint; use `none` for those models.

## Troubleshooting

- **`not_configured`:** VibeCAD could not find the selected provider's environment variable, a valid key in the selected `.env` file, or a keyring entry.
- **No ChatGPT subscription is signed in:** open Preferences, select **ChatGPT subscription**, and complete browser or device-code sign-in.
- **No CAD authoring tools are shown:** select a supported modeling workbench and an engine implemented for it. build123d and OpenSCAD are available only in Part Design.
- **`configured_unverified`:** a key was found but has not been checked against the configured endpoint. Click **Validate**.
- **`invalid`:** the endpoint rejected the key. Confirm the selected provider, base URL, credential precedence, and account access.
- **`offline`:** the key could not be verified because the configured endpoint could not be reached.
- **No models are listed:** validate authentication first, then click **Fetch models**.
- **The model does not support thinking:** set **Reasoning effort** to `none`.
- **The assistant input is disabled:** save the active CAD document.
- **The assistant panel was closed:** reopen it from **View > Panels > VibeCAD Assistant**.

## Project Status

VibeCAD is under active development. The current focus is reliable, readable AI-assisted part design with explicit human control over the document, workbench, modeling engine, and design direction.
