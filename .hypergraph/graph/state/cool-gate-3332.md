## Current

**Unaccepted-project review is verified; training failure and interruption remain untested.** A browser regression and same-machine private-address test of the actual refused-creation project show zero runs, no revision/digest, missing geometry/specs, readable documents and the next `cadex -p` action. The regression verifies project files remain byte-for-byte unchanged after server shutdown. Retain `open`: this covers empty output only, not controlled training interruption, a failed training run, preserved prior completed results or a subsequent successful attempt [rec: zesty-star-7710].

Charter criterion: **D8. Interrupted and failed runs remain understandable** A controlled training interruption, a failed run, and missing/partial review output are tested; the dashboard distinguishes interrupted/failed/stale states from success, preserves prior completed results and explains the next CLI action. Evidence: fault-injection tests and one real interrupted biped training run followed by a successful new attempt; checkpoint resume is not required. Declared target `gap-d8-interrupted-failed-runs-remain` [rec: lucky-comet-0031].

## Negative knowledge

- [scope: the ot5-biped quota-refused creation attempt | confidence: high | evidence: zesty-star-7710] The provider refusal is absent from dashboard run history and has no automatic PROGRESS row; only accepted runs receive those rows. Readable empty-state guidance does not expose the provider error [rec: zesty-star-7710].

## Provenance

- lucky-comet-0031 — the ot5 directive declared this criterion as gap `gap-d8-interrupted-failed-runs-remain`
- dusty-peak-9330 — the owner's charter revision (ADR-284) that introduced D1–D9, claiming none complete
- zesty-star-7710 — empty-project browser regression and real refused-creation evidence; training fault coverage still absent
