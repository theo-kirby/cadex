## Current

1. **Qualify one additional common BLDC candidate (mission 4; rising-banner-4325, brave-stone-9609).** One bounded source-audit unit following docs/L3-COVERAGE.md: define a named common-size acceptance set with a reason tied to robot use, then qualify one additional SKU/winding using manufacturer mounting geometry, kV and a torque operating point with voltage/current/duration/cooling qualifications. Cite inspected revision-specific sources and distinguish missing fields from assumptions. No public API or catalog delivery in this unit; no inference of usable torque from kV, no claim that two motors automatically close plural coverage. If incomplete, record the precise evidence blocker and a bounded next decision, then replan rather than repeating identical searches. GSL/Start evidence and N20 independent verification landed; do not repeat them. [rec: late-pond-3758] [rec: windy-lily-2895] [rec: steady-rain-3009] [rec: frosty-dawn-2061]
2. **Prove the qualified candidate's interfaces, only after item 1 lands with sufficient source evidence (mission 4; rising-banner-4325, brave-stone-9609).** One standalone actual-worker geometry experiment for that SKU: independently measure sourced shaft/collar and mounting interfaces, probe material/void boundaries and a placed instance, and state which geometry is approximate. Keep torque qualifications separate from geometry, installed fit, physical inertia and powered assembly behavior. Record numerical results, source provenance, limitations and real impacts; no public recipe yet. An incomplete source audit blocks this dispatch; a failed proof produces an exact boundary for replanning, not an invented dimension. Run the gates appropriate to the files actually touched, at most one full build. [rec: steady-rain-3009] [rec: windy-lily-2895] [rec: frosty-dawn-2061]
3. **Deliver that one proven BLDC value, only after item 2 passes and is recorded (mission 4; rising-banner-4325, brave-stone-9609).** One catalog/library unit using the existing lib.bldc surface and the qualified SKU contract, independent canonical/placed real-worker interface tests and packaged publication coverage. Carry manufacturer provenance and qualified ratings into current docs; update ADR and ROADMAP facts. Run the full engine suite, at most one required full build, complete install/staging before actual-worker and packaged lifecycle/library checks, and report skips or relocation limitations honestly. Reuse the existing recipe where its geometry contract fits; do not force a new candidate into the old envelope or add actuator dynamics. This delivers one candidate only: full L3, the declared common-size set and deferred solenoids stay open until their own evidence lands.

## Negative knowledge

- [scope: completed GSL and N20 units | confidence: high | evidence: late-pond-3758] Start's committed-HEAD manifest check passed, completing Help/Start's two-removal evidence; GSL checkout cleanup also landed. No repeat deletion, GSL audit or reserved check. Surviving-file modification sets are unchanged by GSL. N20 independent surfaces and 160 probes now pass; full engine 2023 passed/52 skipped, staged lifecycle/library 91 passed. Assumed bore depth and flat transition remain unqualified for fit. The local payload has 144 relocation violations and is not shippable; complete staging before suites. [rec: windy-lily-2895]

- [scope: Start audit findings | confidence: high | evidence: sleepy-stone-2956] The audit is documentation only: no build, configure, install, stage, CTest or packaged gate ran; every disable gate is future. The staged payload prunes `Mod/Start` but still carries `lib/Start.so` (266,296 bytes), so payload absence proves nothing and the disable must confirm the library is gone. `MainCmd` depends on Test (`TestSources`), not Start; Test is not audited and not assumed removable. The 11 `FileUtilitiesTest` registrations leaving is the expected delta, not a regression.

- [scope: Help disable and delete | confidence: high | evidence: steady-dew-8037] Both Help commits landed with gates and records; do not re-run them or rewrite ADR-216 to ADR-218. The `-c` string form of the installed probe crashed; use the script-file form. Iterations 28 to 30 were lost because code and an ADR landed without a record node, the ADR cited a HELP-AUDIT section that did not exist, and the actor then stalled; every unit ends with its record node and cites only doc sections that exist. [rec: zesty-otter-9342]

- [scope: completed Measure sequence | confidence: high | evidence: small-tide-8341] Both disable and source deletion landed; do not redispatch. One shim file (22 lines, 1477 bytes) is not a whole-tree removal. Fresh packaged gates pass; inherited failures match baseline. Broader GUI-source and delta criteria remain open.

- [scope: post-deletion residual GUI | confidence: high | evidence: humble-shore-1680] Directory deletion and its residual audit are landed; all 26 postcommit packaged lifecycle/licensing tests passed. Required Assembly proxies and the Measure App view-provider identity must remain. Active Python install rules survived binary GUI deletion; source names and payload exclusion alone do not prove a tree removable. The existing-payload audit is not fresh proof of a future shim disable/delete.

- [scope: Phase 8 deletion | confidence: high | evidence: fair-cabin-5280] The earlier active Material/Gui metatype dependency and debug GUI-on path are resolved by sharp-pond-0087 and fair-cabin-5280; do not redispatch them. Retained Qt components and mixed Assembly publisher modules remain required. Existing-payload tests and ctests preferring .pixi binaries do not prove a newly deleted source boundary works; deletion needs fresh install/staging gates. The final rpm preset correction had focused coverage only, not a foreign-platform build.

- [scope: deferred solenoid delivery | confidence: high | evidence: open-pine-9349] The 412 proof is partial; older TAU mounting separation conflicts (20 versus 18.2 mm), and Ledex B7 lacks sourced engagement depth and maximum mechanical travel. Do not transplant slots or use the force-plot endpoint as a travel stop. No solenoid API shipped; these bounded searches do not disprove other variants. Resume only on new source evidence or a separately justified contract, not another identical partial model.

- [scope: GUI-attached walk and foreign revisions | confidence: high | evidence: still-badger-2386] The old real-engine overwrite claim was not reproduced: current stale failures omit the model_state needed by dormant replay. Replay and guard adoption are now removed; synthetic regression and real two-engine refusal/refresh recovery passed the full headless gate. This does not serialize simultaneous acceptance or rebuilds; sequential use remains required. Do not redispatch the completed defensive fix or claim general concurrent-write safety.

- [scope: any unit that changes the lifecycle walk | confidence: high | evidence: wild-marsh-9611] The critic rejected iteration 3 because `cli/cadex_cli/project_docs.py` did not change with the walk; the fix-forward pinned the scaffold's Training section to `docs/CLI.md` by a test. A walk change carries the doc and the scaffold in one commit, and a documentation unit names the scaffold sentence it relies on.
- [scope: a warm start under `--remote` | confidence: high | evidence: green-delta-7130] Refused before any leg; the dispatcher copies two files out and the `--init-from` policy is not one of them. Local second-mechanism qualification did not exercise this remote restriction.

- [scope: L2 and second-mechanism qualification | confidence: high | evidence: sage-peak-2689] Both former short dispatches landed. Slider training verified the pipeline, not height holding; do not treat unlike effort units as a design ranking.

- [scope: payload verification sequencing | confidence: high | evidence: stormy-quill-5350] Finish stage-engine before suites inspect the payload; concurrent staging exposed ccx before its normal prune and produced a transient failure.
