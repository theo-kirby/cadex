## Current

1. **Disable only MeshPart's GUI initializer install (mission 3; round-glacier-2865).** The dependency audit landed; do not repeat it. Remove InitGui.py only from the parent INSTALL list, retain its source and preserve App, Init.py, meshFromShape, the shared library and payload directory. Follow ADR-224: quarantine stale installed copies and inspect active build/install/stage locations; complete install and staging before asserting fresh absence. Run at most one full release build, the full engine suite, inherited ctest against its recorded baseline and packaged lifecycle/licensing gates; verify inherited manifest equality and modification notice. Record exact output, ADR/ROADMAP facts and remaining validation limits in this separate disable commit. Existing-payload audit tests are not implementation evidence. [rec: candid-hill-9726] [rec: sharp-oak-9030]
2. **Delete the MeshPart initializer only after recorded disable evidence passes (mission 3; round-glacier-2865, green-sea-3991).** One separate source-delete commit for the audited 73-line InitGui.py; preserve App and export macros. If disable gates are incomplete or regress, finish or fix that evidence before deletion. Verify consumers and generated install absence, at most one full release build, full engine and baseline-compared inherited tests, completed install/stage and fresh packaged lifecycle/licensing gates. Update ADR/ROADMAP and honest manifest/delta measurements, including committed-HEAD manifest evidence; whole-file deletion is not surviving-file M-line savings. This is neither a whole-tree removal nor closure of all GUI-source obligations. Replan after this bounded pair; BLDC searches remain stopped.

## Negative knowledge

- [scope: AT2814 qualification stop | confidence: high | evidence: mild-harvest-8460] The one alternative audit is complete and blocked on current definition, thermal conditions and rating/drawing revision linkage. No winding qualified; no geometry or delivery dispatch. Stop the motor-search sequence, retain set A and require new qualifying evidence plus an explicit replan before resuming; do not repeat RI50 or AT2814 searches. This does not prove qualifying evidence cannot exist.

- [scope: MeshPart disable boundary | confidence: high | evidence: candid-hill-9726] The audit changed documentation only. One parent INSTALL entry remains active; identical 73-line initializer copies are installed and staged, with no release build-copy reference. Removing INSTALL alone leaves stale files. Preserve MeshPart App/Init.py, meshFromShape, its library and payload directory; export macros are outside this unit. Existing-payload 26-pass baseline does not qualify disable or deletion. Separate disable/delete commits require fresh gates.

- [scope: RI50 and BLDC set A | confidence: high | evidence: shy-hill-8139] RI50 is parked: inspected BOM cells and STEP headers do not close thermal operating-point or rating/drawing revision gaps. DWG annotations and the installation video were not inspected; this is no proof that qualifying evidence cannot exist. No repeated identical searches, frameless-to-shafted recipe substitution, kV-derived usable torque or automatic proof/delivery. Set A requires qualified shafted 28xx, hollow frameless 50 and 80 windings; existing Skywalker lacks torque qualification and no alternative is prequalified. [rec: slender-harbor-9625]

- [scope: completed GSL and N20 units | confidence: high | evidence: late-pond-3758] Start's committed-HEAD manifest check passed, completing Help/Start's two-removal evidence; GSL checkout cleanup also landed. No repeat deletion, GSL audit or reserved check. Surviving-file modification sets are unchanged by GSL. N20 independent surfaces and 160 probes now pass; full engine 2023 passed/52 skipped, staged lifecycle/library 91 passed. Assumed bore depth and flat transition remain unqualified for fit. The local payload has 144 relocation violations and is not shippable; complete staging before suites. [rec: windy-lily-2895]

- [scope: Start audit findings | confidence: high | evidence: sleepy-stone-2956] The audit is documentation only: no build, configure, install, stage, CTest or packaged gate ran; every disable gate is future. The staged payload prunes `Mod/Start` but still carries `lib/Start.so` (266,296 bytes), so payload absence proves nothing and the disable must confirm the library is gone. `MainCmd` depends on Test (`TestSources`), not Start; Test is not audited and not assumed removable. The 11 `FileUtilitiesTest` registrations leaving is the expected delta, not a regression.

- [scope: Help disable and delete | confidence: high | evidence: steady-dew-8037] Both Help commits landed with gates and records; do not re-run them or rewrite ADR-216 to ADR-218. The `-c` string form of the installed probe crashed; use the script-file form. Iterations 28 to 30 were lost because code and an ADR landed without a record node, the ADR cited a HELP-AUDIT section that did not exist, and the actor then stalled; every unit ends with its record node and cites only doc sections that exist. [rec: zesty-otter-9342]

- [scope: completed Measure sequence | confidence: high | evidence: small-tide-8341] Both disable and source deletion landed; do not redispatch. One shim file (22 lines, 1477 bytes) is not a whole-tree removal. Fresh packaged gates pass; inherited failures match baseline. Broader GUI-source and delta criteria remain open.

- [scope: post-deletion residual GUI | confidence: high | evidence: humble-shore-1680] Directory deletion and its residual audit are landed; all 26 postcommit packaged lifecycle/licensing tests passed. Required Assembly proxies and the Measure App view-provider identity must remain. Active Python install rules survived binary GUI deletion; source names and payload exclusion alone do not prove a tree removable. The existing-payload audit is not fresh proof of a future shim disable/delete.

- [scope: Phase 8 deletion | confidence: high | evidence: fair-cabin-5280] The earlier active Material/Gui metatype dependency and debug GUI-on path are resolved by sharp-pond-0087 and fair-cabin-5280; do not redispatch them. Retained Qt components and mixed Assembly publisher modules remain required. Existing-payload tests and ctests preferring .pixi binaries do not prove a newly deleted source boundary works; deletion needs fresh install/staging gates. The final rpm preset correction had focused coverage only, not a foreign-platform build.

- [scope: deferred solenoid delivery | confidence: high | evidence: open-pine-9349] The 412 proof is partial; older TAU mounting separation conflicts (20 versus 18.2 mm), and Ledex B7 lacks sourced engagement depth and maximum mechanical travel. Do not transplant slots or use the force-plot endpoint as a travel stop. No solenoid API shipped; these bounded searches do not disprove other variants. Resume only on new source evidence or a separately justified contract, not another identical partial model.

- [scope: GUI-attached walk and foreign revisions | confidence: high | evidence: still-badger-2386] The old real-engine overwrite claim was not reproduced: current stale failures omit the model_state needed by dormant replay. Replay and guard adoption are now removed; synthetic regression and real two-engine refusal/refresh recovery passed the full headless gate. This does not serialize simultaneous acceptance or rebuilds; sequential use remains required. Do not redispatch the completed defensive fix or claim general concurrent-write safety.

- [scope: any unit that changes the lifecycle walk | confidence: high | evidence: wild-marsh-9611] The critic rejected iteration 3 because `cli/cadex_cli/project_docs.py` did not change with the walk; the fix-forward pinned the scaffold's Training section to `docs/CLI.md` by a test. A walk change carries the doc and the scaffold in one commit, and a documentation unit names the scaffold sentence it relies on.
- [scope: a warm start under `--remote` | confidence: high | evidence: green-delta-7130] Refused before any leg; the dispatcher copies two files out and the `--init-from` policy is not one of them. Local second-mechanism qualification did not exercise this remote restriction.

- [scope: L2 and second-mechanism qualification | confidence: high | evidence: sage-peak-2689] Both former short dispatches landed. Slider training verified the pipeline, not height holding; do not treat unlike effort units as a design ranking.

- [scope: payload verification sequencing | confidence: high | evidence: stormy-quill-5350] Finish stage-engine before suites inspect the payload; concurrent staging exposed ccx before its normal prune and produced a transient failure.
