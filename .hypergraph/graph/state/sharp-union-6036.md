## Current

Charter criterion: **D5. Review history survives a design change** Each run retains the model/script revision, specs, task/training configuration, metrics, policy identity and review/video references needed to interpret it; after a design edit and retraining, both runs remain selectable with their own curves, models and videos. Evidence: before/after identity and artifact checks, and browser assertions that old results have not silently switched to the new design. Declared target `gap-d5-review-history-survives-design` [rec: lucky-comet-0031]. No evidence exists yet: the owner's redirect claims no implementation and no criterion completion [rec: dusty-peak-9330]. Flips to working only when the evidence the criterion names is recorded.

## Negative knowledge

None yet.

## Provenance

- lucky-comet-0031 — the ot5 directive declared this criterion as gap `gap-d5-review-history-survives-design`
- dusty-peak-9330 — the owner's charter revision (ADR-284) that introduced D1–D9, claiming none complete
