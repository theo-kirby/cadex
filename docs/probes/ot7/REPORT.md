# ot7 closing report — measured checks, unproven agent outcomes

Verified against source: 2026-09-14. [Cadex-new]

**The measured-fit tools are implemented; the agent's ability to repair or
create fitting mechanisms remains unproven.** All five recorded F4–F7 provider
calls were refused at the session limit, with zero completed design turns.
F4–F7 remain open. This report advances F10's document requirement, but does
not claim successful completion or critic acceptance of done.

This is the critic-requested account of existing evidence at iteration 36.
No design was retried to write it. The charter remains unchanged; its owner
controls checkboxes. Full transcripts, traces and logs stay in external
`cadex-projects/ot7-*` directories; linked portable receipts give relative
paths, byte sizes and SHA-256 digests. An unavailable measurement is never
counted as a pass.

## Design outcomes

A dispatch is a provider invocation; a completed design turn requires actual
agent work. The frozen create prompts and all three continuation prompts are
linked in the [prompt manifest](prompts/README.md), with full hashes and the
original ot6 provenance. Every create attempt used `claude-fable-5`, stopped
on CLI exit 1, and used **zero of three continuations**. No actor design edits
occurred in any of the attempts below.

| Design / criterion | Prompt and attempts | Completed turns / continuations used | Fit failures per dispatch; final static / swept | Inventory / smoke | ot6 comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heron repair / F4 | [Frozen repair](prompts/repair.prompt.txt); two fresh-session refusals, 4.090 s and 4.020 s | 0; same single repair text dispatched twice historically, no follow-on prompt; later collector slot unused | First: before unavailable, restored after 21. Second: 15 before and after. Latest baseline: 15 static failures / sweep unavailable | Baseline has 15 components; no smoke requested or run | First accepted seed `7e9eff5c…` remains unrepaired; all three original defect classes persist |
| Heron arm / F5 | [Frozen create](prompts/heron.create.prompt.txt); one refusal, 1.917 s | 0 / 0 of 3 | Unavailable for sole dispatch; final static unavailable / sweep unavailable | Inventory unavailable; smoke command exit 1, 0.114 s, no simulation | ot6 accepted Heron after three measurement-fed corrections; ot7 produced no design |
| Robin balancer / F6 | [Frozen create](prompts/robin.create.prompt.txt); one refusal, 1.868 s | 0 / 0 of 3 | Unavailable for sole dispatch; final static unavailable / sweep unavailable | Inventory unavailable; smoke command exit 1, 0.114 s, no simulation | ot6 accepted Robin with two actor script corrections; ot7 produced no design |
| Plover biped / F7 | [Frozen create](prompts/plover.create.prompt.txt); one refusal, 3.273 s | 0 / 0 of 3 | Unavailable for sole dispatch; final static unavailable / sweep unavailable | Inventory unavailable; smoke command exit 1, 0.114 s, no simulation | No product-agent biped baseline in ot6: Finch was actor-authored; ot7 produced no design |

For all three creates, there is no accepted revision. Zero pairs and zero
failures in an empty report describe absent geometry. The smoke command could
not find `script.json`; no finite-state, collision or support check ran.
The collector's exit 0 means it retained the refusal, not that a design passed.
The provider reported a 20:20 America/New_York reset; that historical message
is not evidence of subsequent availability or permission to repeat an attempt.

### Refusal receipts and transcript identity

All five calls are retained here, including the two earlier F4 invocations
that preceded the exclusive-slot repair collector. The unused collector slot
does not erase those refusals or represent a completed repair.

| Dispatch | Receipt | Transcript SHA-256 | Causal record |
|---|---|---|---|
| F4 first | [Seed and refusal](retained/repair-refusal.json) | `7f4238888d0925e0fb3a5d2810843a3d01a7103a4155b3ea0ec0a7f07f4bd455` | [lucky-willow-8039](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/lucky-willow-8039.md) |
| F4 iteration 19 | [Second refusal](retained/repair-refusal-iteration19.json) | `5c41384de5d7c3b129467c5a63b9d6980de88507f02cd31ce7a4a6fed09cf19e` | [keen-quill-2265](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/keen-quill-2265.md) |
| F5 iteration 32 | [Arm refusal](attempts/heron-refusal.json) | `813e77ee6c0183c17e4a54dec380f83524ae4183ce763f0bfe7aab3ee9c0dedb` | [quiet-dew-5243](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/quiet-dew-5243.md) |
| F6 iteration 33 | [Balancer refusal](attempts/robin-refusal.json) | `01566753ac81f189b21cc565b300fc00f8d63e4cf63d985989d3663b6b490674` | [keen-chart-9070](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/keen-chart-9070.md) |
| F7 iteration 35 | [Biped refusal](attempts/plover-refusal.json) | `b5b359ec0d0f5465cd1e8520701e3d7c17285881823ed028b03e13996434ea59` | [red-hawk-4600](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/red-hawk-4600.md) |

The repair prompt SHA-256 is
`5d846901563ddef8b278a88f46e9ccfcd1a372f1e38b475743372c20cdcb4904`.
The three create hashes are recorded in their receipts and the
[prompt freeze record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/silent-union-5108.md).
The [attempt narrative](attempts/README.md) retains artifact verification and
per-call accounting. No further dispatch is authorized by this report.

## F4: what the seed measurements actually establish

The seed was copied verbatim from ot6 project commit `14bc75f…`, first accepted
revision `7e9eff5c4ff2640fbaaedd475f7394c0aeae54ce59f6effc067cffeaca8b4475`.
Its old accepted artifact directory was missing. Before the first refused
call, static and swept reads failed. Normal product restore during that call
recreated artifacts and changed the attempt pointer while preserving script,
revision and accepted digest. Its 21-failure report is a restored measurement,
not recovered historical artifact bytes; there is no invented before report.

The later count of **15** is a checker correction, not a design improvement:
ADR-353 removed six nominal-0.1 mm numerical false positives (two bearing gaps
and four servo/tab-screw gaps), using an absolute 1e-9 mm comparison allowance.
The second refused call measured 15 before and after with accepted identity
unchanged. Only ordinary restore metadata changed. The subsequent
[read-only baseline](retained/repair-measurement.json) independently collected
105 pairs and 15 inventory components in 0.164 s with unchanged script and
metadata. [Baseline record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/long-falcon-7461.md).

The baseline contains eight intersections, six below-clearance pairs and one
world-geometry failure. Servo/cheek overlap is about **248.20162986795 mm³**;
`comp_base` still carries the collision plane. Both horn/link gaps are about
**0.2 mm**. Those gaps do not fail the default 0.1 mm clearance minimum because
the seed declares no contact intent. Thus even a future zero-failure static
summary alone would not prove both attachments repaired.

The later [repair collector](runner/README.md) separately requires contact
within 0.001 mm and common volume within 1e-6 mm³ for both original horn/link
pairs. Missing or renamed attachment evidence cannot pass without a functional
identity justification. Its fixtures prove the assessment, not a real repair.
[Collector record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/blue-sky-2193.md),
[assessment record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/western-fox-7010.md).
The exclusive `evidence/f4-repair/` dispatch slot remains unused in the retained
account. No successful after-repair report exists; F4 stays open.

## Implemented checks and evidence for F1–F9

| Criterion | What exists | Evidence and limits |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | Build replies include published static fit counts and every named failing pair; `clearance` inspect is exposed; instructions distinguish stdout claims from measurements | [Implementation](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/happy-dawn-1960.md), [complete-list correction](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/steady-quartz-9854.md), [real pager regression](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/tidy-journey-9462.md), [CLI contract](../../CLI.md). A script printing “no overlap” returns its measured 100 mm³ intersection. Later-page failures and read errors are pinned |
| F2 | Contact and minimum-clearance declarations; overlaps, missed contact, insufficient clearance and world geometry are advisory findings | [Known-answer fixtures](FIT-INTENT.md), [record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/crisp-ember-0302.md), [numerical correction](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/hidden-lodge-4550.md), [script contract](../../XSCRIPT.md). Solid world geometry needs explicit intent; grounding alone does not imply a floor |
| F3 | Published bounded exact-solid hinge and slider sweeps, agent inspection and `cadex clearance --sweep` | [Producer](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/misty-spark-6372.md), [consumer](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/green-river-3790.md), [slider fixtures](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/curious-cedar-4881.md), [Finch product measurement](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/kind-flint-2780.md), [sweep receipt](sweep/README.md). Discrete samples, unsupported or undeclared coverage explicitly incomplete; details below |
| F4 | Two refused frozen calls; preserved seed and measured baseline; collector and attachment assessment tested | [First refusal](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/lucky-willow-8039.md), [second refusal](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/keen-quill-2265.md), [assessment](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/western-fox-7010.md). **Open: no completed repair** |
| F5 | One refused arm create; frozen prompt, transcript and unavailable reports retained | [Record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/quiet-dew-5243.md), [receipt](attempts/heron-refusal.json). **Open: no accepted design or fit/smoke result** |
| F6 | One refused balancer create; equivalent retained evidence | [Record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/keen-chart-9070.md), [receipt](attempts/robin-refusal.json). **Open: no accepted design or fit/smoke result** |
| F7 | New frozen biped prompt; one refused create; equivalent retained evidence | [Record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/red-hawk-4600.md), [receipt](attempts/plover-refusal.json). **Open: no accepted design or fit/smoke result** |
| F8 | One-command bounded smoke over accepted artifacts; passing and failing known-answer fixtures | [Record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/lean-fountain-9707.md), [receipt](f8-smoke.json). Implementation verified; F5–F7 have no executed simulation receipts |
| F9 | Green recorded suites and packaged gate; retained ot6 copies restore/reopen, all measurement differences explained | [Closure record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/narrow-valley-3317.md), [regression receipt](REGRESSION.md), [restore record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/still-raven-7629.md). Carried evidence, not a fresh run for this report |

### F3: measured motion and the absent predicted contact

The known-angle hinge fixture reports first contact at 79° versus analytic
78.522°, within its declared 1° step. The slider fixture locates contact within
one 0.75 mm step of −2 mm. Limits are 73 poses and 2,000 pairs per joint,
90 seconds per joint and 180 seconds per assembly, within the enclosing script
timeout. Other limited joint kinds, unavailable geometry or missing steps are
reported incomplete. Samples are not a continuous collision proof.

A separate product-agent turn on a retained Finch copy added only the sweep
step declaration. It is F3 instrumentation evidence, not a fourth fresh design
or an F7 baseline. At 5°, the fourth hinge exhausted the assembly budget;
at 10°, all four completed in 104.4 s, respectively 35.7, 16.2, 36.2 and
16.3 s. Each completed joint had 406 pairs and solved-pose agreement.
Both knee shin/thigh pairs stayed **1.0 mm apart, 0 mm³ common volume, no
contact**. The charter's predicted contact was absent on this revision.
Forty pairs first contacted at a range's lower limit; none first contacted
inside a range. The agent claimed 44, incorrectly including four 0.05 mm
bearing gaps. This discrepancy is retained as evidence against treating prose
as measurement. See the [product sweep receipt](sweep/README.md).

### F8: smoke implementation is not a design pass

`cadex smoke` preserves accepted identity, checks finite state every solver
step, and measures exact component BREPs at sampled trace poses. A shared
wall-time deadline is capped at 300 seconds. The grounded fixture passed
101 poses; a falling arm overlapped by **1,463.7845106574737 mm³ at 1.64 s**
despite passing proxy collision checks; overlapping boxes measured 400 mm³.
Floor support and penetration use collision proxies, component checks are
sampled, and unavailable BREP evidence cannot pass. These fixture results
establish the command's behavior; no ot7 fresh design ran a smoke simulation.

## Regression and ot6 comparison

The [regression receipt](REGRESSION.md) carries engine **2,142 passed / 53
skipped**, successful build and stage, and packaged lifecycle **18 passed**.
Its CLI checkpoint was **693 passed / 1 skipped**. Later collector work ran
**718 passed / 1 skipped** in 528.12 s; the final assertion was covered by the
subsequent **33 passed** focused runner suite, rather than that already-started
full suite. [Validation record](../../../.hypergraph/graph/record/western-fox-7010.md).
No engine, CLI or packaged gate was rerun for this documentation-only unit;
skips remain unexecuted evidence.

All six retained restore/reopen checks preserved accepted identity and all
787 pair measurements. Final retained revisions have **44 Finch, 39 Robin and
20 Heron static failures**: ot6 explicitly allowed certain screw engagements,
and the old scripts lack contact declarations for seatings and small gaps.
The two final-Heron nominal-0.1 mm flags were removed by the same numerical
correction described above. These are distinct from the six flags removed
from F4's earlier seed. The complete failing sets and their explanations are
in [the retained comparison](retained/README.md) and
[restore receipt](retained/restore-open.json). Legacy sweeps remain unavailable;
compatibility does not imply fit passes.

The [ot6 report](../ot6/REPORT.md) records 55/55 custom Heron fit rules,
84/84 Robin rules and 87 Finch rules. Those custom checks and their explicit
engagement allowances differ from the new product checker. Heron's corrections
used hand-written defect feedback; Robin needed actor edits; Finch had no
model turn. ot7 supplies no new accepted mechanism against which to measure
an improvement in autonomous design. ot6 training results do not substitute
for this run's smoke receipts; no policy training occurred in ot7.

## F10 and what remains open

This page supplies the closing evidence index requested by the critic. F1–F3
and F8 have implemented, fixture-verified checks within the limits above;
F9 has its recorded regression evidence. **F4–F7 remain open**, with refusal
evidence rather than successful or failed geometric design attempts.

F10's requirement that the critic accepted done is also **unmet**. This report
makes no done claim. No retries, fourth design, additional collector hardening,
training, dashboard changes or broader horizon work were undertaken to fill
these gaps. The unused repair collector slot is reported as unused; it is not
an instruction to dispatch it. The run's successful-completion prerequisites
are not established by the existing evidence.
